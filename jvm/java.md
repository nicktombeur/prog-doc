**1\. Object Oriented Programming (OOP)**

Advantages:

  * Modular development of code, which leads to easy maintenance and modification.
  * Re-usability of code.
  * Improved reliability and flexibility of code.
  * Increased understanding of code.

<br />

**1.1 Encapsulation**

Provides objects with the ability to hide their internal characteristics and behavior.

This mechanism aims for controlling the access over the fields or methods of a class and for providing flexibility.

Java provides three keywords:

  * public
    * can be accessed from any other class
  * private
    * accessible only within its own class.
  * protected
    * accessible within its class, it sub-classes and in all classes that reside in the same package.

By using encapsulation we:

  * Combine the data of our application and its manipulation in one place.
  * Allow the state of an object to be accessed and modified through behaviors.
  * Hide the implementation details of an object.
  * Reduce the coupling of modules and increase the cohesion inside them.
  * Create immutable classes that can be used in multi-threaded environments.
  * Increase usability and maintenance of code, because the behavior of an object can be independently changed or extended.
  * Improve modularity by preventing objects to interact with each other, in an undesired way.

**1.2 Polymorphism**

The ability to present the same interface for differing underlying data types.

A polymorphic type is a type whose operations can also be applied to values of some other type, or types.

Side note: from Greek, polys = "many, much" and morphÄ“ = "form, shape"

<br />

**1.3 Inheritance**

Provides re-usability of code and can be used to add additional features to an existing class, without modifying it (inheriting from a class).

<br />

**1.4 Abstraction**

Aims to separate the implementation details of a class from its behavior. Java supports the creation and existence of abstract classes that expose interfaces, without including the actual implementation of all methods.
